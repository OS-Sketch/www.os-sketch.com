# Segmentation of Memory

<v-clicks>

- Basic insights about memory segmentation:

  - Define a base/bound pair for each of the three segments of memory
  - The code, stack, and heap will each have their own base/bound pairs
  - Allow for the independent placement of each segment in memory
  - Segments may grow in different directions and thus we store extra bit

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Challenges that may arise when using segmentation for memory:

  - Program attempts to incorrectly access one of the memory segments
  - Segmentation fault occurs when there is an illegal access of memory
  - Term persists in a wide variety of programming environments!

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Opportunities for making memory management more realistic:

  - Use protection bits to illustrate which code is sharable with other processes
  - Trade-off between coarse- and fine-grained protection of memory

# Memory Fragmentation

<v-clicks>

- What happens when a segment of memory needs to grow?

  - A call to <tt>malloc</tt> may require the heap to grow beyond current space
  - In this situation, the operating system must relocate heap to new physical memory
  - A key challenges: how to pick the new location in memory? what to do with old space?
  - Alternatively, the operating system could reject the request for more heap memory

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Challenges that may arise when relocating memory segments after growth:

  - External fragmentation means that there are many small regions of free space
  - Internal fragmentation means that there is wasted space inside of a segment
  - Compaction can combine external fragments but at the cost of a memory-wide process
  - Difficult for the operating system to pick when region to give to a segment

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- It is common for a process to outgrow its region in the heap!

- Best way to handle memory fragmentation and improve memory utilization?

# Memory Allocation Strategies

<v-clicks>

- Free-list management strategies help the operating system pick new region:

  - **Best fit**: keep a list of free spaces and pick one closest to requested size
  - **Worst fit**: keep a list of free spaces and pick one that best over-compensates
  - **First fit**: keep a list of free spaces and pick first one that fits best

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Which approach is the best? We don't know! Depends on workload!

- Run simulation studies or experiments to determine which best approach

- External fragmentation will still arise and the operating system must address

- Variable-sized segments are necessary and realistic but also a complication;
  operating systems must efficiently and transparently manage memory

- **Questions about how the operating system uses segmentation?**
