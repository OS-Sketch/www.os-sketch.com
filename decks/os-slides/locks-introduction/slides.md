> grasping the abstractions and implementation strategies that enable programs
> to concurrently run on a computer aided by the operating system.

# Motivating and Building Locks

<v-clicks>

- A lock variable ensures that a critical section runs with mutual exclusion

- Lock variables --- or a `mutex` variable --- protects the critical section

- Understanding and manipulating the states of a `mutex` variable:

  - **Available**: the critical section is unlocked or free from threads

  - **Acquired**: the critical section is locked or help by a thread

  - Manipulate the state of the `mutex` through `lock` and `unlock`

- Remember, threads are created by the programmer but scheduled by the OS!

- Locks return control to the programmers and enable critical sections

- Locks are an interface with the programming language, programmer, and OS

# Building and Evaluating Locks

<v-clicks>

- Key questions and concerns associated with the implementation of a lock:

  - How to engineer the lock so that it is **correct** and **efficient**?
  - How will the computer's **hardware** have to support the lock?
  - How will the **operating system** have to support the lock?
  - How will the **programming language** work with hardware and the system?
  - What API will the **programmer** use for creating a lock?
  - How will the lock ensure **fairness** to all threads and processes?

- The easiest way to implement locks is to **disable interrupts**! Any concerns?

  - A programming language thread now has to perform a privileged operation
  - Interrupt disabling does not work on a computer system with multi-processors
  - Disabling of interrupts may introduce fundamental defects into the system
  - This approach is inefficient and may limit parallelism in the system
  - Ultimately, disabling interrupts only works in limited contexts!

# Benefits of Using Threads?

<v-clicks>

- Multi-threaded program has more than one point of execution

- Each thread is like a separate process, except that it shares an address space

- Threads in the same address space can share data and support fast switches

- What are the benefits associated with support threads in the OS?

  - Speed up a computation by supporting parallelism in computations
  - Avoid blocking a program's progress due to slow input/output devices
  - When a process is blocked due to disk access, threads can overlap

- Threading allows for an overlap within programs in the same way that
  multi-programming supported it across programs! Different level of stack!

# Challenges of Using Threads?

<v-clicks>

- A multi-threaded program may have **non-deterministic** behavior when run

- This means that threads make programs hard to reason about and trace

- **Data race**: program results depend on the timing execution of threads

- What are the problematic regions inside of a multi-threaded program?

- **Critical section**: region of code that accesses a share variable

- Want **mutual exclusion** to ensure thread accesses critical section at a time

- Overall, what are the trade-offs associated with multi-threaded programs?

  - Multi-threaded programs can decrease response time and increase throughput
  - But, multiple threads can cause a program's execution to be non-deterministic
  - More critical sections increase determinism by make program less performant

# Using the Thread API in C

<v-clicks>

- POSIX standard defines way to implement and use "P-threads" in C programs

- `pthread_create` allows program to create a new thread in a process

- `pthread_join` allows program to wait for a thread to finish execution

- Maintaining mutual exclusion inside of a P-thread program:

  - `pthread_mutex_lock` enters a critical sections

  - `pthread_mutex_unlock` leaves a critical section

  - P-threads also have **condition variables** for the sending of signals

- Yikes! C, Python, and Go all provide their own API for creating and controlling
  threads! Your initial focus should be on learning the API and avoiding defects.
