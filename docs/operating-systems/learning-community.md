## Community Advice

Sometimes you may not be sure which community forum you should use! Here is some
advice to consider when you face this dilemma. You should use the community
forum that best connects to your situation, as illustrated with these examples.

- If you have a **detailed technical question** or **need technical support**
  with content on the OS Sketch web site, then you should ask it on [GitHub
  Discussions
  Forum](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/discussions). Please
  note that the use of GitHub Discussions is ideal because it allows for the
  marking of an accepted answer to a technical question, which is not available
  through other community forums.

- If you have a **quick technical question** about the site's content, then you
  should ask it on the [OS Sketch Discord
  Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **hang out** or **discuss the challenges** you face as you
  learn more about operating systems, then you should go to the [OS Sketch
  Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **share or receive career advice** with other people who are
  exploring the field of operating systems, then you should go to the [OS Sketch
  Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **offer feedback** about OS Sketch content, then you should
  create an issue in the [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).

- If you want to **report a bug** in either the **source code** or the **written
  content** on OS Sketch, then you should create an issue in the
  [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).

## Integration Guidelines

- In order to properly create a pull request (PR), the user should follow simple syntactic
  rules so that all requests are uniform:

- The first letter of the PR should be capitalized, and the first word should be in the 
  imperative case.

- There should be no periods.

- The description should be meaningful and concise (less than 50 characters).

- Commit messages should follow the link below.

- [Link to How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

- The follow process work with Linux, Mac, and Windows.

- Make sure you excute local builds before creating a PR. First you will run `poetry install`  
  then run `poetry run mkdocs serve`.

- To see the local build copy the link and paste it into your browser. 

- In order to leave the local build hit `control + c`.

- You must run it local to see preview changes before making a lot of pull requests.

- Add all of the Integration team to every pull request. Make sure that only 2 reviewers are 
  **required** to merge the pull request.

- Two reviews should be selected for the PR. One reviewer from the creatorâ€™s team and one
  reviewer from the integration team. Both reviewers should utilize the netlify
  preview feature.

- Once both reviewers have agreed the PR does not have any issues, the addition will be added.

- Github usernames for the integration team:

- hinckleyc, burgess01, waryankaa, antlet, Yanqiao4396
