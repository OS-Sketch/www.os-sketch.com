# Learning Community

## Resource Links

The OS Sketch community offers several ways in which you can grow in your
knowledge of operating system and your technical and engineering skills. Try
out the following resources and let us know what you think!

- [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues)
  allows you to, for instance, offer feedback on this site and report a defect
  in the source code examples that it features. To get started, log into your
  GitHub account and click the green button called "New Issue".

- [GitHub Discussions
  Forum](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/discussions) gives
  learners the opportunity to ask and answer questions about the projects on
  this site. Upon completion of a discussion you can mark the accepted answer
  and help out others who face the same challenge. To get started, log into your
  GitHub account and click the "New discussion" green button.

- [OS Sketch Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6) provides a way for
  members of the OS Sketch community to use text and video to chat with each
  other. To get started, click the link and accept the invitation to join the
  community. After you have setup your account and connected it to your email
  address, you can start to participate in the discussion.

## Community Advice

Sometimes you may not be sure which community forum you should use! Here is some
advice to consider when you face this dilemma. You should use the community
forum that best connects to your situation, as illustrated with these examples.

- If you have a **detailed technical question** or **need technical support**
  with content on the OS Sketch web site, then you should ask it on [GitHub
  Discussions
  Forum](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/discussions). Please
  note that the use of GitHub Discussions is ideal because it allows for the
  marking of an accepted answer to a technical question, which is not available
  through other community forums.

- If you have a **quick technical question** about the site's content, then you
  should ask it on the [OS Sketch Discord
  Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **hang out**, **discuss the challenges** you face as you learn
  more about operating systems, or **share fun links** to new systems and
  tools, then you should go to the [OS Sketch Discord
  Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **share or receive career advice** with other people who are
  either exploring and working in the field of operating systems, then you
  should go to the [OS Sketch Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **offer feedback** about OS Sketch content, then you should
  create an issue in the [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).

- If you want to **report a bug** in either the **source code** or the
  **written content** on OS Sketch or **make a suggestions** for new content,
  then you should create an issue in the [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).

## Integration Guidelines

- To ensure the creation of uniform pull requests (PR), you should follow these
  syntactic rules:

    - The first letter of the pull request (PR) title should be capitalized,
      and the first word should be in the imperative case.
    - There should not be a period at the end of the PR's title.
    - The description should be meaningful and concise (less than 50
      characters).

- Commit messages should follow the rules described by the [Conventional
  Commits Standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).
  Here is an example:

    ```
    fix: Add the correct percentages to grading table in syllabus
    ```

- So as to avoid unnecessary builds on Netlify, excessive pushes to pull
  requests should be avoided if possible. In order to preview your changes to
  the web site, please adopt the following process that requires
  [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

    - In the directory of the repository, run `poetry install`, then `poetry run
      mkdocs serve`.
    - To see the local build, copy the link and paste it into your browser.
    - In order to leave the local build, use `control + c` in the terminal.

- Add every member of the Integration team as reviewers to every pull request.
  Make sure that only 2 reviewers are **required** to merge the pull request.

- Two reviews should be selected for each PR. One reviewer from the creatorâ€™s
  team and one reviewer from the integration team. Both reviewers should
  utilize the netlify preview feature.

- Once both reviewers have agreed that the PR does not have any issues, the
  addition will be added.

- Please tag for reviews one member of your team and one additional individual
  who has expertise in reviewing the content of your pull request.
