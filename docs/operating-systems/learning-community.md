## Community Advice

Sometimes you may not be sure which community forum you should use! Here is some
advice to consider when you face this dilemma. You should use the community
forum that best connects to your situation, as illustrated with these examples.

- If you have a **detailed technical question** or **need technical support**
  with content on the OS Sketch web site, then you should ask it on [GitHub
  Discussions
  Forum](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/discussions). Please
  note that the use of GitHub Discussions is ideal because it allows for the
  marking of an accepted answer to a technical question, which is not available
  through other community forums.

- If you have a **quick technical question** about the site's content, then you
  should ask it on the [OS Sketch Discord
  Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **hang out** or **discuss the challenges** you face as you
  learn more about operating systems, then you should go to the [OS Sketch
  Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **share or receive career advice** with other people who are
  exploring the field of operating systems, then you should go to the [OS Sketch
  Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6).

- If you want to **offer feedback** about OS Sketch content, then you should
  create an issue in the [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).

- If you want to **report a bug** in either the **source code** or the **written
  content** on OS Sketch, then you should create an issue in the
  [GitHub Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues).
