## Advanced Programming

A person who is learning the fundamentals of operating systems should
demonstrate mastery of the following programming skills in myriad of necessary
programming languages:

### Programming

- Write short programs up to five hundred lines that have the following
  characteristics for the chosen programming language:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style for the chosen programming language.
    - Has descriptive comments for all program components that adhere to an
      industry-standard coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style for the chosen language.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework for the chosen language, showing that it correctly implements
      the specification for the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the a components's performance in
      minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly simulates aspects of an operating system (e.g., process
      scheduling) through the use of a program.

### Programming Tools

- Use a Docker and/or operating system-based programming environment that
  supports a recent version of the C, Go, and Python programming languages to
  complete these tasks while implementing a program up to five hundred lines of
  code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the
      [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language environment to
      create, run, and debug a Python program with a terminal window, a text
      editor, and the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager.
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the
      [C](https://gcc.gnu.org/) programming language toolchain to create, run,
      test, and debug a C program through a terminal window and/or a text
      editor.
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the [Go](https://go.dev/)
      programming language environment to create, run, test, debug, and format a
      C program through a terminal window and/or a text editor.
    - Use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to
      implement, test, debug, document, and manage the source code of a Python
      program, leveraging plugins for workflow enhancement.

## Version Control

- Use the [GitHub](https://github.com/) platform and the
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system in the following fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a command in a
      terminal window or an extension for Git integration in a text editor like
      VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that use the [Conventional
      Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard explain
      the specific way in which a commit changes the source code and
      documentation in the GitHub repository.
    - Navigate reports produced by [GitHub
      Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do and do not adhere to a project's
      specification.
    - In either a team-based on individual context, use the [GitHub Flow
      model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to implement specific
      features in a branch of a GitHub repository and then merge that branch to
      the main one only after all the checks run by GitHub Actions pass as
      required and code reviews confirm the code's correctness.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues with the
      [GitHub Issue
      Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues) and the
      [GitHub Discussion
      Forum](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/discussions),
      furnishing descriptive titles and problem descriptions that adhere to
      industry best practices and project templates.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Effective Learning

A person learning about operating systems will demonstrate mastery of the
following technology-mediated learning skills:

- Follow a systematic process when using resources to implement C, Go, and
  Python programs:
    - After detecting an error in a program through the use of either automated
      or manual debugging, develop a satisfactory understanding of the problem's
      likely root cause and then search sites like [Stack
      Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for potential solutions.
    - After evaluating suggested solutions to a programming problem that
      originate from sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/),
      develop a way to fix an error in a program, try that approach, and then
      incrementally improve it.
    - Independently develop solutions to programming problems even if the
      specifical technical challenge that you face was not previously covered in
      a course session or as part of your prior review of technical content.

- Use [Discord](https://discord.com/) to effectively communicate about
  technology in the following fashion:
    - In the correct public channel, post a question that includes source code
      segments, screenshots, and a description of the steps taken in an attempt
      to solve a problem.
    - Answer questions that were posted in a public channel, responding with
      source code segments, screenshots, and links to external references,
      pointing the proactive programmer who asked the question in the right
      direction without solving the problem for them and limiting their
      opportunity to learn more about the topic in question.
    - Proactively offer to help others who may need to learn scientific,
      mathematical, or technical knowledge and skills that a learner has already
      mastered by sharing the acquired knowledge or skill, how you can be
      contacted, and how you can help.

## Improving Objectives

As [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/) explains, a learning objective is
**clear** when it is "clear from the students' perspective" and **measurable**
when there is "some way to know whether the objective has been met" or "how far
away the learner is from meeting it".[^1] Do you see a way in which we can improve
the learning objectives for data abstraction? If you do, then please participate
in the [OS Sketch community](../learning-community/) by sharing your ideas for
improving them!

Write Learning
Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
details about how to design learning objectives for an academic course. From
your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
clear and measurable for an advanced course on the topic of operating systems?
