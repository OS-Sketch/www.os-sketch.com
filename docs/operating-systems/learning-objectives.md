## Advanced Programming

A person who is learning the fundamentals of operating systems should
demonstrate mastery of the following programming skills:

### Programming

- Write short programs up to five hundred lines that have the following
  characteristics for the chosen programming language:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style for the chosen programming language.
    - Has descriptive comments for all program components that adhere to an
      industry-standard coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style for the chosen language.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework for the chosen language, showing that it correctly implements
      the specification for the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance in seconds or
      milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly simulates aspects of an operating system (e.g., process
      scheduling) through the use of a Python program.

### Programming Tools

- Use a Docker and/or operating system-based programming environment that
  supports a recent version of the C, Go, and Python programming languages to
  complete these tasks while implementing a program up to five hundred lines of
  code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the
      [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language environment to
      create, run, and debug a Python program with a terminal window, a text
      editor, and the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager.
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the
      [C](https://gcc.gnu.org/) programming language toolchain to create, run,
      test, and debug a C program through a terminal window and/or a text
      editor.
    - Install, upgrade, and use a recent version of the [Go](https://go.dev/)
      programming language environment to create, run, test, debug, and format a
      C program through a terminal window and/or a text editor.
    - Use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to
      implement, test, debug, document, and manage the source code of a Python
      program, leveraging plugins for workflow enhancement.
