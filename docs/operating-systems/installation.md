## Installing the required tools for Windows

### gcc & ```make``` command

1. Do not install MinGW directly, go to https://www.msys2.org/ and download MSYS2.
2. Search for the MSYS2 MinGW x64 environment and open it.
3. Write ```pacman -Syuu``` to update the environment.
4. Write ```pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain``` to install the toolchain, which contains gcc and the make command.
5. Verify the installation worked by entering ```gcc â€”version``` in your terminal. If it is working it should return the version of gcc you installed.
6. In order to use the gcc toolchain, you have to add this to your path environment variable: <MSYS2 location>/mingw64/bin .
7. You can also change the name of make from mingw32-make to make to make it easier to execute in the terminal.
8. In order to test everything went correctly, create two new files in a directory named hello.c and makefile.
    1. Hello.c should contain:
      ``` #include <stdio.h>
 
      int main() {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
          return 0;
      }```
    2. Makefile should contain:
      ``` all: hello.exe

      hello.exe: hello.o
          gcc -o hello.exe hello.o

      hello.o: hello.c
          gcc -c hello.c
          
      clean:
          rm hello.o hello.exe```
9. Navigate to the directory in your terminal, enter make and see the program run!
