# Introduction

An operating system is responsible for managing and protecting the resources of
a computer. The exploration of operating systems centers around topics such as
virtualization, concurrency, persistence, and security. The operating system is
one of the most complex software systems that humans have implemented. Your use
of a computer is normally mediated by some operating systems like Linux. Even
though many software engineers do to need to implement their own operating
system, there are significant benefits to understanding how operating systems
work.
