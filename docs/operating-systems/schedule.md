# Course Schedule

<!-- TODO: Use a comment to assign at least two students for each module. These -->
<!-- students will be responsible for the following tasks: -->
<!--   1) Create a sketch using Excalidraw to illustrate the key concepts in the module -->
<!--   2) Create and review a pull request to ensure that SVG files (i.e., normal -->
<!--   and inverted) are placed inside of the course slides and course web site. This -->
<!--   pull request should also include the original Excalidraw file as well! -->
<!--   3) Review the course slides for that week and raise at least one issue in -->
<!--   the GitHub Issue Tracker for improving the existing content -->

## Course Setup

### Professional Question

- What technical content about operating systems will we cover this semester,
  how will we assess our mastery of this technical material, and how will we
  structure all aspects of this advanced course in operating systems?

### Next Steps

- Review and participate in all the discussions in the [OS Sketch Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues) for more
  details.

## Systems Introduction

### Technical Questions

- How can does the operating system use the principle of **virtualization** to
  manage the resources of a computer such as the process, memory, and file
  system? How does virtualization influence the way in which I program and use
  an operating system?

### Next Steps

- *Introduction* and *Processes* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/operating-systems/systems-introduction/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Virtualization**: the process of taking a physical resource such as a
      processor or memory and transforming it into a more general, powerful, and
      easy-to-use virtual form.

## Locks and Conditional Variables

### Technical Questions (chapters 28 and 30)

- What are locks, and how do they aid in **concurrency**?  What are some problems using locks can cause?  What is the greatest benefit we get from condition variables in relation to locks?  How do these two ideas interact?

### Next Steps

- *Locks* and *Conditional Variables* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

- Chapter 7
1. **Workload** - simplifying assumptions about the processes running in the system
2. **First In, First Out (FIFO)** - means the first element in, is the first element out
3. **Shortest Job First (SJF)** - runs the shortest job first, then the next shortest, and so on

- Chapter 9
1. **Proportional-Share** - instead of optimizing for turnaround or response time, a scheduler might instead try to guarantee that each job obtains a certain percentage of CPU time
2. **Ticket** - used to represent the share of a resource that a process should receive
3. **Ticket Currency** - allows a user with a set of tickets to allocate tickets among their own jobs in whatever currency they would like
4. **Ticket Transer** - a process can temporarily hand off its tickets to another process
5. **Ticket Inflation** - a process can temporarily raise or lower the number of tickets it owns

- Chapter 13
1. **Stack** - a linear data structure that follows the principal of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
2. **Heap** - an area of pre-reserved computer main storage (memory) that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won't be known until the program is running
3. **Virtualizing Memory** - the system can load larger or multiple programs running at the same time, enable each on eot operate as if it has more space, without having to purchase more RAM

- Chapter 15
1. **Limited Direct Execution (LDE)** - letting the program run directly on the hardware; however at certain key points in time, arrange so that the OS gets involved and makes sure the "right" thing happens.
2. **Address Translation** - the hardware transforms each memory access, changing the virtual address provided by the instruction to a physical address where the desired information is actually located.
3. **Static Relocation** - which a piece of software known as the loader takes an executable that is about to be run and rewrites its addresses to the desired offset in physical memory
4. **Free List** - a list of the ranges of the physical memory which are not currently in use.

- Chapter 16
1. **Segmentation Fault** - arises from a memory access on a segmented machine to an illegal address.
2. **Sparse Address Spaces** - large address spaces with large amounts of unused address space.
3. **External Fragmentation** - a general problem that arises when physical memory quickly becomes full of little holes of free space, making it difficult to allocate new segments, or to grow existing ones.

- Chapter 28
1. **Spinning** - a thread being told to wait before the action is executed based on a lock being in place.
2. **Mutual Exclusion**: if one thread is in the critical section it excludes others from entering.
3. **Fairness**: does each thread contending for the lock get an equal shot at it.
4. **Performance**: time added by using the lock.

- Chapter 30
1. **Condition variable**: an explicit queue threads can put themselves on when some state of execution is less desirable than another thread.  When it changes state the other threads can be woken up and allowed to continue.
2. **Wait/Signal**: the actions used in a conditional variable.  The thread waits on a specific condition to be met and then signals the sleeping threads to be executed.
3. **Bounded Buffer**: a system of multiple producer threads and consumer threads which is shared.

- Chapter 31
1. **Deadlock** - A problem that occurs when a consumer thread is called before the producer when trying to use mutual exclusion.
2. **Throttling** - An imposed limit to the number of threads that can be simultaneously executed on a piece of code.  Used to keep the system from bogging down.
3. **Zemaphore** - An easier-to-implement version of the semaphore where we don‚Äôt maintain the value of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting threads.
4. **Hill‚Äôs Law** - Sometimes simple and dumb is better.  Just because you can make something sophisticated to solve a problem doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best answer.

- Chapter 36
1. **DMA (direct memory access)** - a device within a system that orchestrates transfers between devices and memory without much CPU intervention.
2. **Memory-mapped I/O** - Another method to interact with devices.  With this version the hardware makes device registers available as if they were memory locations.  Helpful because no new instructions are needed to support it.
3. **Hardware Interface** - The way for the software to communicate and interact with the hardware system.
4. **Internal Structure** - Responsible for implementing the abstraction the device presents to the system.

- Chapter 39
1. **Persistent Storage** - A permanent storage device that keeps information intact after a loss of power.
2. **File** - An array of bytes that can be created, read, written and deleted.  Low level name is i-number.
3. **Directory** - An array of tuples, each containing a human-readable and low-level name to which it is mapped.
4. **Directory Tree** - Organizes all files into a tree, starting with the root.
5. **Hard Link** - An entry in the file system tree.  Takes two arguments (old path name and new) and creates another way to refer to that same file.
6. **Symbolic (soft) Link** - Different type of link that allows links to files in other disk partitions than the one the original file is in.
