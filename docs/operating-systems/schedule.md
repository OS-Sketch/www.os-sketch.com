# Course Schedule

<!-- TODO: Use a comment to assign at least two students for each module. These -->
<!-- students will be responsible for the following tasks: -->
<!--   1) Create a sketch using Excalidraw to illustrate the key concepts in the module -->
<!--   2) Create and review a pull request to ensure that SVG files (i.e., normal -->
<!--   and inverted) are placed inside of the course slides and course web site. This -->
<!--   pull request should also include the original Excalidraw file as well! -->
<!--   3) Review the course slides for that week and raise at least one issue in -->
<!--   the GitHub Issue Tracker for improving the existing content -->

## Course Setup

### Professional Question

- What technical content about operating systems will we cover this semester,
  how will we assess our mastery of this technical material, and how will we
  structure all aspects of this advanced course in operating systems?

### Next Steps

- Review and participate in all the discussions in the [OS Sketch Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues) for more
  details.

## Systems Introduction

### Technical Questions

- How can does the operating system use the principle of **virtualization** to
  manage the resources of a computer such as the process, memory, and file
  system? How does virtualization influence the way in which I program and use
  an operating system?

### Next Steps

- *Introduction* and *Processes* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/operating-systems/systems-introduction/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Virtualization**: the process of taking a physical resource such as a
      processor or memory and transforming it into a more general, powerful, and
      easy-to-use virtual form.

## Locks and Conditional Variables

### Technical Questions

- What are locks, and how do they aid in **concurrency**?  What are some problems using locks can cause?  What is the greatest benefit we get from condition variables in relation to locks?  How do these two ideas interact?

### Next Steps

- *Locks* and *Conditional Variables* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

## Semaphores

### Technical Questions

- What are we lacking from conditional variables and locks that Semaphores solve?  How does this fit into concurrency?

### Next Steps

- *Semaphores* chapter in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

## I/O Devices, Files and Directories

### Technical Questions

- How should I/O be integrated into the system?  How can we make them efficient?
- How should the OS manage a persistent device? What are the APIs?  What are the important aspects of the implementation?

### Next Steps

- *I/O Devices* and *Files and Directories* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

- Chapter 28
1. **Spinning** - a thread being told to wait before the action is executed based on a lock being in place.
2. **Mutual Exclusion**: if one thread is in the critical section it excludes others from entering.
3. **Fairness**: does each thread contending for the lock get an equal shot at it.
4. **Performance**: time added by using the lock.

- Chapter 30
1. **Condition variable**: an explicit queue threads can put themselves on when some state of execution is less desirable than another thread.  When it changes state the other threads can be woken up and allowed to continue.
2. **Wait/Signal**: the actions used in a conditional variable.  The thread waits on a specific condition to be met and then signals the sleeping threads to be executed.
3. **Bounded Buffer**: a system of multiple producer threads and consumer threads which is shared.

- Chapter 31
1. **Deadlock** - A problem that occurs when a consumer thread is called before the producer when trying to use mutual exclusion.
2. **Throttling** - An imposed limit to the number of threads that can be simultaneously executed on a piece of code.  Used to keep the system from bogging down.
3. **Zemaphore** - An easier-to-implement version of the semaphore where we don‚Äôt maintain the value of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting threads.
4. **Hill‚Äôs Law** - Sometimes simple and dumb is better.  Just because you can make something sophisticated to solve a problem doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best answer.

- Chapter 36
1. **DMA (direct memory access)** - a device within a system that orchestrates transfers between devices and memory without much CPU intervention.
2. **Memory-mapped I/O** - Another method to interact with devices.  With this version the hardware makes device registers available as if they were memory locations.  Helpful because no new instructions are needed to support it.
3. **Hardware Interface** - The way for the software to communicate and interact with the hardware system.
4. **Internal Structure** - Responsible for implementing the abstraction the device presents to the system.

- Chapter 39
1. **Persistent Storage** - A permanent storage device that keeps information intact after a loss of power.
2. **File** - An array of bytes that can be created, read, written and deleted.  Low level name is i-number.
3. **Directory** - An array of tuples, each containing a human-readable and low-level name to which it is mapped.
4. **Directory Tree** - Organizes all files into a tree, starting with the root.
5. **Hard Link** - An entry in the file system tree.  Takes two arguments (old path name and new) and creates another way to refer to that same file.
6. **Symbolic (soft) Link** - Different type of link that allows links to files in other disk partitions than the one the original file is in.
