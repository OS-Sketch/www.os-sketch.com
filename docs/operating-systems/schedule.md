# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Technical Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore data abstraction with the Python programming
  language?

### Next Steps

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the list of [proactive
  technical skills](/proactive-skills/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills/).

## Systems Introduction

### Technical Questions

- How can does the operating system use the principle of **virtualization** to
  manage the resources of a computer such as the process, memory, and file
  system? How does virtualization influence the way in which I program and use
  an operating system?

### Next Steps

- *Introduction* and *Processes* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/operating-systems/systems-introduction/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Virtualization**: the process of taking a physical resource such as a
      processor or memory and transforming it into a more general, powerful, and
      easy-to-use virtual form.
