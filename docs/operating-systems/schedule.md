## Important Terms

### Introduction: Chapter 2

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Virtualization** - the process by which the operating system takes a
      physical resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and
      transforms it into a more general, more powerful, more secure, and
      easier-to-use virtual version of itself
    - **Concurrency** - managed by the operating system and/or the programming
      langauge, the situation in which multiple computations happen at the same
      time
    - **Persistence** - the process of storing data in a computer system, as a
      way of ensuring that data survives after the ending of the process that
      created it

    ###### [Return](#systems-introduction) to the *Systems Introduction* module

### Processes: Chapter 4

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Process** - it is the operating system that takes these bytes and gets them
      running transforming the program into something useful
    - **Process API** - consists of calls programs can make related to processes
      Typically, this includes creation, destruction, and other useful calls
    - **Process state** - including running, ready to run, and blocked; different
      events (e.g., getting scheduled or de-scheduled, or waiting for an I/O to
      complete) transition a process from one of these states to the other
    - **Process list** - contains information about all processes in the system

    ###### [Return](#systems-introduction) to the *Systems Introduction* module

### Process API: Chapter 5

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Process Identifier** - used to name the process if one wants to do something with the process, such as (for example) stop it from running
    - **Fork** - is used in UNIX systems to create a new process
    - **Scheduler** - determines which process runs at a given moment in time
    - **Superuser** - controls all processes (and indeed do many other things); this role should be assumed infrequently and with caution for security reasons

    ###### [Return](#process-execution) to the *Process Execution* module

### Direct Execution: Chapter 6

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Time Sharing** - when you run one process for a little while,then run another one, and so forth
    - **Limited Direct Execution** - to make a program run as fast as one might expect
    - **User and Kernel Mode** - the approach we take is to introduce a new processor mode. The operating system runs in
    - **Context Switch** - when the OS, during a timer interrupt or system call, might wish to switch from running the current process to a different one

    ###### [Return](#process-execution) to the *Process Execution* module

### Memory API: Chapter 14

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Stack Memory** - allocations and deallocations of it are managed implicitly by the compiler for you
    - **Buffer Overflow** - a related error is not allocating enough memory
    - **Purify and Valgrind** - both are excellent at helping you locate the source of your memory-related problems

    ###### [Return](#process-execution) to the *Process Execution* module

### CPU Scheduling: Chapter 7

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Workload** - simplifying assumptions about the processes running in the system
