# Course Schedule

<!-- TODO: Use a comment to assign at least two students for each module. These -->
<!-- students will be responsible for the following tasks: -->
<!--   1) Create a sketch using Excalidraw to illustrate the key concepts in the module -->
<!--   2) Create and review a pull request to ensure that SVG files (i.e., normal -->
<!--   and inverted) are placed inside of the course slides and course web site. This -->
<!--   pull request should also include the original Excalidraw file as well! -->
<!--   3) Review the course slides for that week and raise at least one issue in -->
<!--   the GitHub Issue Tracker for improving the existing content -->

## Course Setup

### Professional Question

- What technical content about operating systems will we cover this semester,
  how will we assess our mastery of this technical material, and how will we
  structure all aspects of this advanced course in operating systems?

### Next Steps

- Review and participate in all the discussions in the [OS Sketch Issue
  Tracker](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/issues) for more
  details.

## Systems Introduction

### Technical Questions

- How can does the operating system use the principle of **virtualization** to
  manage the resources of a computer such as the process, memory, and file
  system? How does virtualization influence the way in which I program and use
  an operating system?

### Next Steps

- *Introduction* and *Processes* chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/operating-systems/systems-introduction/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Virtualization**: the process of taking a physical resource such as a
      processor or memory and transforming it into a more general, powerful, and
      easy-to-use virtual form.

## Learning Opportunities
