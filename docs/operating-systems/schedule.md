## Important terms

Introduction: Chapter 2

1. **Virtualization** - the OS takes a physical resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of itself.
2. **Concurrency** - When multiple computations are happening at the same time
3. **Persistence** - The context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended.

Processes: Chapter 4

1. **Process** - It is the operating system that takes these bytes and gets them running transforming the program into something useful.
2. **Process API** - consists of calls programs can make related to processes. Typically, this includes creation, destruction, and other useful calls.
3. **Process state** -  Including running, ready to run, and blocked. Different events (e.g., getting scheduled or descheduled, or waiting for an I/O to complete) transition a process from one of these states to the other.
4. **Process list** - Contains information about all processes in the system.

Process API: Chapter 5

1. **Process Identifier** - Used to name the process if one wants to do something with the process, such as (for example) stop it from running. 
2. **Fork** - Is used in UNIX systems to create a new process.
3. **Scheduler** - Determines which process runs at a given moment in time.
4. **Superuser** - Controls all processes (and indeed do many other things); this role should be assumed infrequently and with caution for security reasons.

Direct Execution: Chapter 6

1. **Time Sharing** - When you run one process for a little while,then run another one, and so forth. 
2. **Limited Direct Execution** - To make a program run as fast as one might expect.
3. **User and Kernel Mode** - The approach we take is to introduce a new processor mode. The operating system runs in.

CPU Scheduling: Chapter 7

1. **Workload** - simplifying assumptions about the processes running in the system
2. **First In, First Out (FIFO)** - means the first element in, is the first element out
3. **Shortest Job First (SJF)** - runs the shortest job first, then the next shortest, and so on

Lottery Scheduling: Chapter 9

1. **Proportional-Share** - instead of optimizing for turnaround or response time, a scheduler might instead try to guarantee that each job obtains a certain percentage of CPU time
2. **Ticket** - used to represent the share of a resource that a process should receive
3. **Ticket Currency** - allows a user with a set of tickets to allocate tickets among their own jobs in whatever currency they would like

1. **Stack** - a linear data structure that follows the principal of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
2. **Heap** - an area of pre-reserved computer main storage (memory) that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won't be known until the program is running
3. **Virtualizing Memory** - the system can load larger or multiple programs running at the same time, enable each on eot operate as if it has more space, without having to purchase more RAM

Memory API: Chapter 14

1. **Stack Memory** - Allocations and deallocations of it are managed implicitly by the compiler for you.  
2. **Buffer Overflow** - A related error is not allocating enough memory.
3. **Purify and Valgrind** - Both are excellent at helping you locate the source of your memory-related problems

Address Translation: Chapter 15

1. **Limited Direct Execution (LDE)** - letting the program run directly on the hardware; however at certain key points in time, arrange so that the OS gets involved and makes sure the "right" thing happens.
2. **Address Translation** - the hardware transforms each memory access, changing the virtual address provided by the instruction to a physical address where the desired information is actually located.
3. **Static Relocation** - which a piece of software known as the loader takes an executable that is about to be run and rewrites its addresses to the desired offset in physical memory
4. **Free List** - a list of the ranges of the physical memory which are not currently in use.

Segmentation: Chapter 16

1. **Segmentation Fault** - arises from a memory access on a segmented machine to an illegal address.
2. **Sparse Address Spaces** - large address spaces with large amounts of unused address space.

2. **Disassembler** - shows what assembly instructions were used in the program.
3. **Transaction** - grouping of many actions into a single atomic action.
4. **Critical Section** - piece of code that when accesses a shared resource, usually a variable or data structure.
5. **Race Condition** - arises if multiple threads of execution enter the critical section at roughly the same time.

Thread API: Chapter 27

1. **Function Pointer** - looks for which function threads should start running in.
2. **Procedure Call** - creates a thread or multiple threads.
3. **Critical Section** - region of code that needs to be protected for operation.

Locks: Chapter 28

1. **Spinning** - a thread being told to wait before the action is executed based on a lock being in place.
2. **Mutual Exclusion**: if one thread is in the critical section it excludes others from entering.
3. **Fairness**: does each thread contending for the lock get an equal shot at it.
4. **Performance**: time added by using the lock.

Condition Variables: Chapter 30

1. **Condition variable**: an explicit queue threads can put themselves on when some state of execution is less desirable than another thread.  When it changes state the other threads can be woken up and allowed to continue.
2. **Wait/Signal**: the actions used in a conditional variable.  The thread waits on a specific condition to be met and then signals the sleeping threads to be executed.
3. **Bounded Buffer**: a system of multiple producer threads and consumer threads which is shared.

Semaphores: Chapter 31

1. **Deadlock** - A problem that occurs when a consumer thread is called before the producer when trying to use mutual exclusion.
2. **Throttling** - An imposed limit to the number of threads that can be simultaneously executed on a piece of code.  Used to keep the system from bogging down.
3. **Zemaphore** - An easier-to-implement version of the semaphore where we don‚Äôt maintain the value of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting threads.
4. **Hill‚Äôs Law** - Sometimes simple and dumb is better.  Just because you can make something sophisticated to solve a problem doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best answer.

3. **Mount Protocol** The first process through which the clients and servers connect together.
4. **Virtual File System (VFS)** Allows for the use of multiple file systems to be utilized for a given operating system.
5. **Write Buffering** The delayed sending of the clients data to the server. The submitted data to the network is first held locally in the client's cache.

Data Integrity and Protection: Chapter 45

1. **Fail-Stop** An early feature of RAID systems where either the disk is working or not at all.
2. **Silent Faults** When the storage drive disk doesn't give any appearance of a problem when the data returned is corrupted.
