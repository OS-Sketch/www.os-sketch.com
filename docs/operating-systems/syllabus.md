### Course Meeting Schedule

- Discussion and Group Work Session: Monday and Wednesday, 8:00 AM-9:15 AM
- Laboratory Session: Wednesday, 2:30 PM-4:20 PM

### Course Description

A study of the principles used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of
operating systems. Participating in hands-on activities that often require
teamwork, students create and assess components of an operating system that runs
on modern computer hardware. Leveraging insights and tools from an industry
partner, students also investigate the resource management, process scheduling,
and file systems used in representative operating systems. During a weekly
laboratory session students use advanced operating systems software to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved
laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during
class and lab sessions.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 200
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Required Textbook

[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
by [Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and [Andrea C.
Arpaci-Dusseau](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/)

### Course Policies

#### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the
assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category               | Percentage |
|------------------------| -----------|
| Course Participation   |  5%        |
| Course Web Site        |  10%       |
| Midterm Examination    |  10%       |
| Final Examination      |  15%       |
| Long-Term Project      |  20%       |
| Laboratory Assignments |  40%       |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Course Participation**: After either an unexcused absence or a late
    attendance to class on two separate occasions, a student's course
    participation grade will be reduced by half a percentage for each additional
    time they are absent or late in an unexcused fashion. Students who need to
    miss class or attend late for an excused reason should communicate their
    situation to the course instructor as soon as possible. Students who are
    sick should communicate their situation to the course instructor at their
    earliest convenience and not attend any in-person class sessions.

-   **Course Web Site**: Throughout the semester students are invited to
    contribute content to the OS-Sketch web site in the form of, for instance,
    technical diagrams (i.e., a sketch of an operating system component), source
    code segments that comprise part of a laboratory assignment, enhancements to
    technical writing, and new written content. By the end of the semester, each
    student should make at least ten substantive contributions &mdash; excluding
    the merge of a pull request &mdash; to the web site, as evidenced through
    the GitHub repository's [commit
    listing](https://github.com/OS-Sketch/www.os-sketch.com/commits/master).

-   **Midterm Examination**: The midterm is an online cumulative assessment
    covering all of the material from the class and laboratory sessions, as
    outlined on the [course schedule](/operating-systems/schedule/). Unless
    prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be
    expected to use their computer to take this test on the scheduled date and
    to complete it in the stated location while taking no more than the required
    amount of time.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is an online cumulative assessment covering
    all of the material from the class and laboratory sessions, as outlined on
    the [course schedule](/operating-systems/schedule/). Unless prior
    arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be
    expected to use their computer to take this test on the scheduled date and
    to complete it in the stated location while taking no more than the required
    amount of time.

-   **Long-Term Project**: Students will propose, design, implement, test, and
    experimentally evaluate a significant software component of an operating
    system as part of this project that will take place over approximately half
    of the academic semester. The long-term final project will afford learners
    the opportunity to explore, in greater detail and in an independent fashion,
    some aspect of operating systems referenced by the course [course
    schedule](/operating-systems/schedule/).

-   **Laboratory Assignments**: These assignments invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting operating system components or concepts. As part of these
    assignments, learners will use the data collected from running experiments
    to evaluate the implementation of an operating system component as they
    consider trade-offs between, for instance, its efficiency and effectiveness.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and Google Calendar. Electronic versions of the laboratory
assignments must be submitted to the instructor through a student's GitHub
repository created by GitHub Classroom. No credit will be awarded for any
laboratory assignment work that you submit to the incorrect GitHub repository.
Unless special arrangements are made with the instructor, no work will be
accepted after the published assignment deadline. Students who are completing
work for the OS-Sketch web site must do so in accordance with the content
integration guidelines described in the [learning
community](/operating-systems/learning-community/) content.

#### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your assignment's
GitHub repository, you will privately receive a grade for and feedback on each
assignment. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed
correct work that fulfills the project's specification and whether or not you
submitted the project by the deadline.

#### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions and should instead send a status
update to the course instructor at their earliest convenience.

#### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class discussions, laboratory, and programming sessions.
During the class periods, the course instructor will often pose challenging
questions that could require group discussion, the creation of a Python program
or data table, a vote on a thought-provoking issue, or an in-class presentation.
Only those students who have prepared for class by reading the assigned material
and reviewing the current course assignments will be able to effectively
participate in these class discussions.

Importantly, only prepared students will be able to acquire the knowledge and
skills that they need to be successful in this course, subsequent courses, and
the field of web development. In order to help students remain organized and to
effectively prepare for classes, the OS-Sketch web site features a [course
schedule](/operating-systems/schedule/) with, for instance, reading assignments
and presentation slides. During the class sessions students will also be
required to download, use, and modify source code segments and data sets that
are made available through means such as the course web site or a GitHub
repository.

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
either a class, laboratory, or programming session are encouraged to seek
assistance from the course instructor and the student technical leaders.
Students should, within the bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions
on the Discord server for our course; please request assistance from the
instructor and student technical leaders first through Discord before sending an
email. Students who need the course instructor's assistance must schedule a
meeting through his web site and come to the virtual meeting with all of the
details needed to discuss their question. Students can find out the office hour
schedule student technical leaders by viewing the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication,
as summarized in the list of [community
connections](/operating-systems/learning-community). We will use GitHub for the
sharing of both source code and course projects and for reporting issues in
those materials. We will use a Discord server for all other course discussions:
the [OS Sketch Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9VfCdqffu6) provides a way for
members of the proactive community to use text and video to chat with each other
and will be the main forum for the discussion of technical content in operating
systems.

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use Discord for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All
students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following
pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

#### Effective Collaboration

Computer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. People must work
together to produce large, complex, and ultimately useful software systems.
Because of this, the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College
encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of
individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own
knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not
acceptable.

- Acceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Discussing high-level concepts, such as the use cases for `while` loops
      or the various methods that can add elements to a `list`.
    - Referring someone to a course text book, course slides, or other
      resources that contain helpful information or instructions.
    - Outlining the high-level steps to solving a problem or implementing a
      feature, without mentioning specific lines of code that need to be
      written.

- Unacceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Sharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your
      source code to someone or looking at someone else's code.
    - Copying someone else's source code, technical writing, or program output,
      even with some slight modifications.
    - Typing source code, technical writing, or program commands on someone
      else’s laptop or computer.

The aforementioned forms of communication are unacceptable because they make it
difficult for both the course instructor and a learner to assess individual
knowledge. Moreover, these unacceptable forms of collaboration can impede your
learning or someone else's learning since an individual is less likely to
understand source code or technical writing that you do not create by themself.
Importantly, any student who participates in these unacceptable forms of
collaboration, whether they are the one sharing, showing, looking, copying, or
typing, are in violation of the Honor Code at Allegheny College.

In summary, students should collaborate as long as they do so in acceptable
ways. With that said, if a student needs assistance beyond what can be gained
through acceptable forms of collaboration, they should seek help from the
course instructor or a technical leader. If a student submits deliverables
(e.g., source code or technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work
of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

#### Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 814-332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons
and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to
ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

### Welcome Message

In reference to software, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. wrote in chapter one of *The
Mythical Man Month* that "the magic of myth and legend has come true in our
time." It is so exciting that we can write programs that "come alive" on our
computers! Moreover, efficient Python programs that correctly use, store and
manipulate data have the potential to positively influence the lives of many
people. Moreover, the design, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of
Python-based software are exciting and rewarding activities! The course
instructor invites you to pursue, with great enthusiasm and vigor, this
adventure in rigorous Python programming.
